I'm from Johns Creek, GA; however, I now live in _East Atlanta Village_ with my sister. I am an Economics major. I plan on graduating this Spring 2023.


## My Goals
Three years from now, I see myself getting my Masters from Stockholm School of Economics in International Business or Economics. I see myself living in Stockholm, Sweden with a nice Swedish boyfriend, traveling to other European cities on the weekends. Two years from now, I see myself as a Senior Software Engineer, further developing my understanding for systems architecture at Chick-Fil-A. I plan to stay reading updates on global affairs and global finance. I see myself picking up pilates and joining an Atlanta tennis team. One year from now, I see myself graduated from Georgia Tech with a software engineering job, surrounded by ambitious, curious, intelligent people. I see myself getting really good at cooking, so that one day I can compete on MasterChef.

### Admirable Job Titles

- Quant Trader
- Fortune 500 CEO
- Entrepreneur (Efficient manufacturing company in US for designers who order small batches)
